        <h2>Crispy chicken hamburger</h2>
        <p>Crispy chiken is my wife's favorite! Imagine a toasted sesame seed bun cradling a succulent beef patty, 
            its edges caramelized and juices brimming. Melted cheese drapes over the patty, 
            its gooey embrace welcoming crisp lettuce, juicy tomato, and a tangy whisper 
            of red onion.<br>
            This good-good ain't shy. Each bite whispers secrets of perfectly seasoned beef, 
            its char playing counterpoint to the creamy mayo and tangy ketchup
             peeking from beneath the bun. The crunch of lettuce and tomato adds rhythm, 
             while the onion's sharp kick leaves you wanting more.</p>
