This is my first HTML project. I'm going to demonstrate the new skills I've learned, including:

How to initially create a boiler HTML
How to set up the head and body
    In the head:
        How to revise the title
        How to set up the meta charset
    In the body:
        How to write a paragraph
        How to add line breaks
        How to use <strong> and <em> to indicate text importance
        How to insert links and images
        The difference between absolute and relative paths
